Ammy's Advent of Code solutions for 2024. (Sorry, this is _not_ a repo about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.)

This is being done with two main goals:
- learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) better
- learn [Typst](https://typst.app) at all

So don't expect the code to be that of an expert. :)

Most of the day-to-day notes are in `notes.typ`.
